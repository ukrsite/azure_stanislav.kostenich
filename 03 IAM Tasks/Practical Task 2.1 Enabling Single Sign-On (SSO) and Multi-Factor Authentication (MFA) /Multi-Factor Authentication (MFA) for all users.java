### **Option 1: Using Azure AD Security Defaults**  
Security Defaults are an easy way to enforce MFA for all users in your tenant.  

1. **Enable Security Defaults**:  
   1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).  
   2. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** → **Properties** → **Manage Security Defaults**.  
   3. Set **Enable Security Defaults** to **Yes** and save changes.  

   > **Note**: Security Defaults enforce MFA for all users and administrators without fine-grained control.

### **Option 2: Configure Conditional Access Policies**  
For more granular control over MFA enforcement, create a Conditional Access policy.  

1. **Sign in to the Azure Portal**:  
   Go to **Azure Active Directory** → **Security** → **Conditional Access**.  

2. **Create a New Policy**:  
   1. Click **+ New policy** and provide a name (e.g., "Enforce MFA").  
   2. Under **Assignments**, configure the following:
      - **Users or workload identities**: Select **All users** or specific groups.  
      - **Cloud apps or actions**: Choose **All cloud apps** or select specific ones.  
   3. Under **Access controls**, set **Grant** to:  
      - **Require multi-factor authentication**.  

3. **Enable the Policy**:  
   Set the policy to **On** and click **Create**.

### **Option 3: Use Per-User MFA**  
This method enables MFA on a per-user basis.  

1. **Navigate to the MFA Settings**:  
   Go to **Azure Active Directory** → **Users** → **Per-user MFA** (under **Manage**).  

2. **Enable MFA for Users**:  
   Select the users to enable MFA, click **Enable**, and confirm.  

3. **Notify Users**:  
   Inform users that they will be prompted to set up MFA the next time they sign in.

### **Best Practices for Enforcing MFA**
1. **Exclude Break-Glass Accounts**:  
   Ensure you have at least one emergency access account excluded from MFA enforcement to avoid accidental lockouts.  

2. **Monitor Sign-Ins**:  
   Use Azure AD Sign-In Logs to track MFA adoption and troubleshoot issues.  

3. **Communicate with Users**:  
   Provide clear instructions for setting up and using MFA (e.g., via the Microsoft Authenticator app).  

4. **Consider Azure AD Premium P1 or P2**:  
   These plans provide additional features like Conditional Access and Identity Protection for advanced MFA scenarios.
